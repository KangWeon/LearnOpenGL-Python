# learnopengl.com code repository (Python version)
Python translation of the popular [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)'s source code and exercise repository.
Currently chapters 1-6 have been completely translated.

The translation is very close to the original C++ source code, which makes it easy to use alongside the tutorial.

Most examples should run right out of the box, as they install the PyPI requirements automatically from the respective `requirements.txt`.

You can find the examples in the `src` folder.  
To run the first example you simply need to run `src/1.getting_started/1.1.hello_window/hello_window.py`.

Here are some screenshots of the examples (one from each chapter):
